# Python-Trojan-Service-workers
basically a python trojan named service workers so the user doesn't pretty much detect it
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So what It does is that this trojan file takes screenshot in every 3 minutes, generates letter and sends it to an email (U gotta provide password and email to program) 

It also creates directory called Program Files inside C: disk, but as soon as it runs the directory is hidden, so user will kinda not look for it too much
( some other directories are created inside Program files too ) 
you can find where this python trojan file saves image by this path: C:\System Apps\Other\Other
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


also it can start on windows startup too, u gotta add it to startup folder tho
you can access startup folder by this combination:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


WIN + R on keyboard
and copy that trojan file inside that directory
before you that, and if you run python on your machine you can easily convert it into executable file by auto-py-to-exe module which you can install by this command in terminal - pip install auto-py-to-exe
